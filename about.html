This page is going to be all about me.
      I can't wait to expand it.

          Hello my name is Nathan Sirois and I am a buisness management student at the University of Rhode Island. I row for the school on the club crew team and I am also apart of the 
          Rhody Christian Fellowship group here at the school. Other than that, in my spare time I like to go on adventures off campus and see places around Rhode island and the local eateries.
          I'm throughly enjoying my time so far on campus this semester and I hope that it continues to stay that way.
