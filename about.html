This page is going to be all about me.
      I can't wait to expand it.

          Hello my name is Nathan Sirois and I am a business management student at the University of Rhode Island. I row for the school on the club crew team and I am also a part of the Rhody Christian Fellowship 
          group here at the school. Other than that, in my spare time I like to go on adventures off campus and see places around Rhode island and the local eateries. I especially enjoy finding places around that 
          have well made coffee and pizza along with a few other niche foods that I like like french onion soup.
          
          When I'm not feeling like going out to have fun I greatly enjoy movies and television with friends. I will watch anything as long as its made well and even sometimes if it's made poorly if it is funny enough. 
          Video games are also a fun way for me to destress, although with this programming course I definitely have not had as much time to play them as normal. I'm thoroughly enjoying my time so far on campus this 
          semester and I hope that it continues to stay that way.
         
        </p>
